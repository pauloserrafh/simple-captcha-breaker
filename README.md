# simple-captcha-breaker
**_Disclaimer: This is a personal project that aims to be useful for a better 
understanding of captchas, image processing and python.
It is NOT to be used to help spamming or similar activities._**

## About 
This projects aim in simple captchas. With letters same with the same size 
and usually in the same place of the image.
Examples are in the trainingset folder.

As you can infer from the code, I am not  an expert python coder or have 
experience with image processing. So do not expect a clean code. Most of
it was trial and error and have not been fully tested yet. Hence the comments
of pieces of code so I can test or debug.

The first commits are with big chuncks of code because I just created something
that ~~works~~ and uploaded to avoid losing it. Maybe in the future I put more
comments in the code. Or you can look in the references (most of it is based on
Boyter solution). 

### Does it work? I think so. Still creating the training set.
### Is it efficient? Not at all. 
### Is it pythonic? Don't think so.
### Should you use it? It's up to you.

## References
I've used a lot of references from the web. Starting from python tutorials to
image processing and specifics for captcha breaking. Some of the references
are also (some are only there) in the code.
